// Codecademy is the writer of the activity that produced this program

// Students would benefit from doing something like this as a challenge
// Example: Converting a word to a magic spell from Harry Potter 

// Also, change the program so that it has an input as opposed to having to hard code the input everytime

//Variables
var input: String = "Programming is fun!"
var output: String = ""

// For loop
for char in input {
  let lowerChar = char.lowercased()
  
  // Switch statement
  switch lowerChar{
    case "a", "i", "o":
      output = output + lowerChar.uppercased()
    case "e":
      output = output + "EE"
    case "u":
      output = output + "UU"
    default:
      continue
  }
}

// Output
print(output)
