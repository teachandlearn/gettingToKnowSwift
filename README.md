# gettingToKnowSwift

Codecademy has a quick Swift learning program. As I explore options for new curricula, I felt that I needed to learn the syntax of Swift. 

This project is a place to put all the small activities and projects that I did as a reference and inspiration for when I program and teach with Swift. I made the project public because it may be useful to others as teachers or learners.

In addition to Codecademy projects, I will also put projects of my own design that might be proper assignments for students to follow.
I will also, on occassion, add my own spin to the Codecademy projects.
