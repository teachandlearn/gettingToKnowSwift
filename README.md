# gettingToKnowSwift

Codecademy has a quick Swift learning program. This project is a place to put all the small activities and projects that I did as a reference for when I program and teach with Swift. I made the project public because it may be useful to others as teachers or learners. 

In addition to Codecademy projects, I will also put projects of my own design that might be proper assignments for students to follow.
